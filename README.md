# codes-c
<h1>Hello there :smiley:</h1>

This repository contains codes created by me using the C programming language.

This language was my first contact with programming, as a Computer Engineering graduate.

Here in this repository you will find everything from initial programming programs to games developed during academic activities.

I hope you enjoy the content.
